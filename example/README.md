lotusJS Samples
=============
To get started with these samples run  `npm install` then `node server`. 
Node will start a server at port 3000. You can optionally pass a port, for example `node server 3500`
Once the server starts you can load the samples below

**IMPORTANT**: the UMD module used in the examples includes immutable.
I recommend creating projects in TypeScript and using WebPack to produce 
your bundles. The UMD used in the example is strictly for demo purposes.

Available at `localhost:${port}/button`.
This is an example of how to use the `Lotus.Button`.
