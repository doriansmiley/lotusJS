lotusJS Samples
=============
To get started with these samples run  `npm install` then `node server`. 
Node will start a server at port 3000. You can optionally pass a port, for example `node server 3500`
Once the server starts you can load the samples below

**IMPORTANT**: I recommend creating projects in TypeScript and using WebPack to produce 
your bundles. The UMD used in the example is strictly for demo purposes.

### Button

Available at `localhost:${port}/button`.
This is an example of how to use the `Lotus.useButton` function. 
Source code is in the `./button` directory

### Image Gallery
Available at `localhost:${port}/image-gallery`.
This is an example of how to use the `Lotus.useImageGallery` function. 
Source code is in the `./image-gallery` directory. It's really just
and image list, but it could easily be extended to include infinite scroll, 
enlargements, etc. It's a work in progress.
